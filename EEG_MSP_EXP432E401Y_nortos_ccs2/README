Both the Master and datacompression versions of this program work in a similar manner. 
The main function setups the system clock and then immidieatly delays to allow
for the voltages on the ADS1299 to stabilize. Next the pins that are gonna be used 
to control the ADS1299 are set up. Then the SPI peripheral is setup on the MSP.
The ADS1299 is now set up for reading external signals. After the ADS1299 is setup 
the USB is setup. Next we enter the main loop for the program. The MSP is trapped 
in an empty while loop, waiting for a computer to tell it to start sampling. 
In the meanwhile changes to the ADS1299 can be made. Once the computer tells it 
to start it then checks the data rate of the ADS1299 and sets up a couple of variables
that allow for usb transfers to happen easily. There is then a delay as when in daisy
chain it takes a little longer for data acquisition to start on the ADS1299. 
Here is where the two programs slightly differ. The master program just acquires data 
from the ADS1299 and immidiately puts it in the USB buffer. It repeats this until the computer
tell it to stop acquisition.
The data compression version acquires the first sample, stores it calls it the base and transfers it to 
the computer. Then it starts acquiring the next samples but it does not transmit them
it. Instead it takes the difference between this new sample and the base and transmit
it. It repeats this process until the computer says to stop data acquisition.
